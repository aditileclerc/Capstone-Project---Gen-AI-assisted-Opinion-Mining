# Capstone-Project---Gen-AI-assisted-Opinion-Mining-for-Financial-Stability-Prediction

**ABSTRACT**

Many individual investors face challenges in accessing timely and relevant investment insights, often missing critical information about a company’s financial stability. Traditional investment models, focused on historical financial data, frequently overlook qualitative factors like public sentiment and market reactions, which significantly influence stock performance. This lack of a blended approach—incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data—has created demand for tools that provide a more comprehensive analysis. Existing financial forecasting tools primarily emphasize structured financial data without effectively integrating real-time sentiment analysis from sources like social media and news. Consequently, investors are often left with incomplete insights into how external factors, like public sentiment, may impact their decisions.

To address these gaps, we propose a solution that utilizes Generative AI and Opinion Mining to enhance financial stability predictions. By combining traditional financial data with real-time sentiment analysis from social media and news sources, our model delivers a holistic view of the factors affecting stock performance. Our Time-Series Transformer Model captures shifts in sentiment and links them with stock price trends, stored in a Vector Database to allow real-time updates and efficient data retrieval. This innovative approach empowers investors by blending sentiment-driven insights with financial indicators, offering a more nuanced understanding of market trends and stock stability. Through the integration of advanced AI and sentiment analysis, our model provides individual investors with actionable, data-driven insights to support more informed investment decisions and opens up new possibilities for financial forecasting in an ever-evolving market landscape.

To predict a company’s financial stability (by analyzing various metrics) using Generative AI and sentiments (curated through opinion mining).

- We will be using a vector database of company data, public sentiments, financial statements to perform opinion mining.
- Based on the sentiments, features will be determined, and the generative model will be built to predict different stability measures, such as stock prices.
- Filling this gap will help from the consumer point of view, for example, when investing in a public company’s shares.
