"Is r/Science getting some kind of political leaning through choice of thread topics, particularly psypost?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/meta/comments/1ews85l/is_rscience_getting_some_kind_of_political/,4,"I've not delved into whether this is due to a posting or moderator influence, but over the past couple of years, **r/Science** is showing an increasing percentage of left-leaning and feminist topics within a global move toward sociological posting with a bias.

However benevolent the intention, the trend seems to be away from ""hard"" science (physics, chemistry, biology...). Often the articles supporting the ""good cause"" (so to speak) report studies that ignore scientific good practices such as 

* Objectivity, impartiality and independence. ...
* Honesty in communication.
* not stating intended conclusions before establishing the methodology.
* providing references (not relying on socially accepted ""facts"" or conventional wisdom)
* not pandering to expectations of funding sources.

Today for example, among 27 link posts, the r/Science front page shows the following:

1. male sexism
2. women victimized in grant applications
3. Trump populism
4. Republicans contesting election results
5. narcissistic CEO's
6. Police misbehavior against Black residents
7. free bicycle distribution in India helps rural girls
8. Better social norms improve gender equality (nurture > nature)

So that's 8/27 of politically oriented articles, all to the Left. 

Isn't science supposed to be neutral and isn't this all the more important in a US-centric gateway in an election year?

**Edit:** I said ""a couple of years"", but just came across [this thread from three years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/lcd9xa/whats_going_on_with_people_of_rscience_calling_to/) which says exactly  the same I just did, even with similar wording. This to add that I do personally support many (but not all) of the POV expressed in these articles, but think they should be excluded from scientific debate, at least to the extent they all lean in the same direction. Not only that, but they could fuel a narrative about ""Mar“≥ist infiltration"". Its probably best to keep that kind of debate away from science.

Now that Reddit has started to do the same thing the other social media sites are doing (secretly hiding your comments which failed a spam/toxicity filter, while you yourself can still see them), every time you comment you have to check Incognito to make sure the comment actually stayed publicly visible, which is a chore and a waste of time.

I am not 100% sure this behavior was from Reddit vs the Subreddit. However, we can confidently conclude it's not a simple word filtering algorithm because other comments with the curse word did stay up. It appears to be a very inaccurate machine learning spam/toxicity filter, so I'm guessing this applies reddit-wide.

Also, going forward, if you were in a long argument and someone stopped responding to you, you would need to comment again to check whether they actually DID reply to you thinking they got a last word, but only they can see it because Reddit blocked it from public view. Makes for a very poor and stressful commenting experience because of all the uncertainty.","When posting to a good sub such as r/Science, you need to keep your language proper in the first place.

Why are there so harsh restriction to post anything on sertian subreddits?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/meta/comments/1dwq4li/why_are_there_so_harsh_restriction_to_post/,2,"Hello, 

I have had many posts auto-removed due to karma restrictions or controversial content. I read the rules of subreddits and ensure I follow them, but it seems that anything critical or that might start a discussion gets removed. 

The karma restriction is meant to prevent new accounts or bots from spamming. I understand that, but it feels unfair to Redditors who enjoy reading a lot on Reddit and have never posted before. Now, they have to farm karma to post, which doesn‚Äôt seem right. 

Why are so many subreddits against controversial discussions or criticism? It feels like only positive things are allowed, and anything that asks the community for opinions on critical thinking is removed. Of course, I always follow the rules, avoiding harassment or anything toxic.

Do you believe Reddit still actively reflects a participatory media/ Web 2.0? (AKA discussing Reddit on Reddit impacting Reddit's Redditing),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meta/comments/1cvvlue/do_you_believe_reddit_still_actively_reflects_a/,1,"When it comes to examples of Web 2.0 and the idea of participatory media, Reddit is pretty neat example. You've got this massive platform where users are the ones creating most of the content, it's not just the media or influencers governing the content and it provides a platform for our niche personal interests alongside mainstream topics.

Through upvotes and downvotes, we collectively curate the platform's content. It‚Äôs a uniquely democratic approach to content moderation that empowers users to actively shape the platform themselves.

The communities then serve as virtual gathering places where individuals with shared passions come together to share content, engage in discussions, and forge connections, without actively needing to search for it like on alternative platforms.

Another important aspect is the volunteer moderators, drawn from the community itself, enforcing subreddit-specific rules to ensure discussions remain civil and on-topic. This diplomatic approach to moderation empowers each community to govern their own rules.

So yeah IMHO, when it comes to Web 2.0, Reddit is definitely one of the best examples out there. It's all about users creating, sharing, and engaging with content in a way that's truly democratic and community-driven.

Do you believe Reddit is still a good example of Web 2.0? Are there better examples now (since the rise in advertisements etc. on Reddit)?","I think that, in principle, the Reddit approach is quite a good one. Giving users so much control over the content they post and consume is very consumer-friendly, a rarity on the modern internet.

That said, I do worry about post-IPO Reddit. Now there's a more explicit incentive to monetize the site beyond what has been the standard for about a decade, namely the corporate accounts, sponsored posts, and the ubiquitous internet ads.

It's been [noted](https://investor.redditinc.com/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/Reddit-Q1-24-Earnings-Call_Transcript.pdf) in [many places](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm) over the last few months that posts like yours and comments like mine constitute one of the largest predominantly English language corpora on the internet. While this has been attractive to companies trying to get indirect access to users and their associated data since the very beginning, it's [only now](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/02/reddit-has-already-booked-203m-in-revenue-licensing-data-for-ai-training/) that [this](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/) is going to be so [directly monetized](https://www.thestack.technology/reddit-will-fuel-googles-llm-with-user-posts-others-should-think-twice-before-trying-to-do-the-same/).

It's good to keep this in context by comparing Reddit to other social media platforms. With ones like Facebook, the key value is the relationships between users. That allows advertisers to use existing connections to influence users based on their social circles, a practice which has since become commonplace online. On sites like Twitter, advertisers attempt to use larger-scale behavioral patterns to achieve their goals. It's a bit more impersonal, but it allows ads to reach more people at once.

I'm of the opinion that the latest iteration of Reddit's attempted monetization will try to bridge the gap between the 'personal but limited reach' and 'impersonal with large reach' paradigms of internet advertisements. A user's voting history allows ads to be curated to their personal tastes, while the self-imposed segmentation of users into subreddits based on their interests allows for the targeting of larger groups at once.

I don't know what the solution to this very foreseeable problem might be. Reddit itself got a large boost in popularity with the death of Digg, so it's plausible that Reddit's communities might simply migrate to another site. However, Reddit alternatives have existed for a while now, and there doesn't appear to be any mass exodus of users, no matter what sort of potentially inciting incident occurs. It might also be a retreat to the older boards and forums style of online communities, though I doubt that that sort of clear regression of functionality would be embraced by more than a few users.

This is a very real situation that needs to be addressed in the near future, but my best reading of the situation is, ironically, that most users would rather put off any deeper discussion on the topic in favor of the more comfortable convenience of doing nothing about it. My hope is that posts like yours will eventually get people to consider the consequences of an increasingly corporate internet before it's too late.",think principle reddit approach quite good one giving user much control content post consume consumerfriendly rarity modern internet said worry postipo reddit there explicit incentive monetize site beyond standard decade namely corporate account sponsored post ubiquitous internet ad noted many place last month post like comment like mine constitute one largest predominantly english language corpus internet attractive company trying get indirect access user associated data since beginning going directly monetized good keep context comparing reddit social medium platform one like facebook key value relationship user allows advertiser use existing connection influence user based social circle practice since become commonplace online site like twitter advertiser attempt use largerscale behavioral pattern achieve goal bit impersonal allows ad reach people im opinion latest iteration reddits attempted monetization try bridge gap personal limited reach impersonal large reach paradigm internet advertisement user voting history allows ad curated personal taste selfimposed segmentation user subreddits based interest allows targeting larger group dont know solution foreseeable problem might reddit got large boost popularity death digg plausible reddits community might simply migrate another site however reddit alternative existed doesnt appear mass exodus user matter sort potentially inciting incident occurs might also retreat older board forum style online community though doubt sort clear regression functionality would embraced user real situation need addressed near future best reading situation ironically user would rather put deeper discussion topic favor comfortable convenience nothing hope post like eventually get people consider consequence increasingly corporate internet late

Today I clicked on a few of them, and they are still active, with current posts, yet I see the same old ones all the time.  The point of subscribing is to see them in my feed. ","2 things: 

* **There's a 'best' and 'hot' algorithm.** If you're using a 'best' then your feed will be custom tailored to your activity, or which subs you've been more active in, as well as other considerations. If you're using 'hot' then it doesn't add any filters, or other considerations, other than time, the amount of votes something gets, and if your feed/page is lacking displaying a sub (meaning it can show you very old content from a sub if nothing has been posted on that sub for a while, because reddit will treat the most recent posts on an 'inactive sub' as trending); so, *hot* is sometimes better if you want to force a more balanced view, rather than one that's trying to be 'overly friendly', and customized.

* **If you are not a reddit member you can only see 50 subs at one time.** THis means if you are subscribed or follow more than that, it will randomly select 50, and only show those for the entire day (or 6 to 12 hours, something like that), I think.

I've been perma banned from other subs as well and in my experience, mods are usually not willing to answer the question of exactly why.

I understand that measures are necessary. But this is ridiculous. I don't know what I did wrong. I mean, I can live without this sub, but it's a kind of a sword of Damocles that creates an atmosphere of rather biting your tongue instead of freely expressing yourself, stifling creativity and individuality in general, not only the maybe justifiedly unwanted part of that freedom.

YOU killed Reddit. Thanks.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/meta/comments/1c8xuu5/you_killed_reddit_thanks/,5,"You are a slave.

Nietzsche described the slave mentality well. You are the epitome of what he describes as a slave.

Why?

Because your consciousness has devolved into memes.

And your memes have devolved into moderation.

Orwell described this as well in the destruction of language. The less words in the dictionary, the better.

This is you.

As I continue to insult you, how do you fathom a response? You will comb through your library of predetermined memes and find that set of words which best fits as a rebuttal.

Even if you are able to transcend your own memefication, you will resort to typing a long-winded response which ultimately only proves your mastery of English grammar.

You have lost your ability to think independently. You have lost your ability to think freely. YOU are a SLAVE. And YOU killed Reddit.

And the reason why? Because you are a Redditor. What is Reddit? Reddit is slavery.

In your youth, Nerd culture was counterculture against the historical concept of the Bro.

But if you‚Äôre familiar with ‚ÄúThe Conquest of Cool‚Äù, you would understand how capitalist elements are able to infiltrate counterculture, modify them, and ultimately, commodify them.

That‚Äôs you. You‚Äôre no longer just a slave. You‚Äôre a commodity. You‚Äôre a Redditor.

And ironically, the ‚Äúbros‚Äù you used to oppose‚Ä¶ they have become the counterculture.

Every time you applaud mods for deleting posts, every time you downvote those who go against you, you are further entrenching yourself into your own self-imposed slavery.

YOU are the problem. You think the advertisements, the brands, the IPO, you think these things damaged Reddit? NO. The problem is YOU, and only YOU.

And why? Because you are a slave who thinks you‚Äôre free.

When a person opens TikTok, they admit self-defeat. They admit idiocy. But you? When you open Reddit, you boast of intelligence. You imagine yourself as part of a grander plan. Yes, slave! You are part of a grander plan.

Now go dig the trenches.

As Mao Zedong once said, self-reflection is like washing your face or cleaning your room. It needs to be done every day. You see the pimples on your face, and you say, no worry. I‚Äôm a nerd. It‚Äôs OK. I like Star Wars. I like hobbies. I like being a slave.

But the day is coming soon. Those pimples of yours? They‚Äôre going to pop. And what, exactly, comes out of pimples?

Better distinguish between an unpopular opinion and an unpopular way of expressing it or doing so in the wrong place. From experience, its better not to just say ""I think *x*"" without saying ""because"" and quoting some supporting evidence. If you're doubting what someone says, then rather than outright disagreeing, you can frame your doubt as an open question. On a forum, you should be doing the same as in everyday life where you go along with the current but steer the conversation around without entering into opposition.

I've never really cared other than like, oh neat i have 100k karma nwo | I can only hope that in the near future the whole dumbass karma system will be replaced by an AI that actually manages to calculate what kinds of posts and comments carry any actual value. | > Meanwhile, I can jump on a less serious sub, respond to a post with a stupid two word comment like this or this, and suddenly I'm receiving thousands in karma.

That pretty much reflects what happens IRL in society. Often intelligent people say stupid things to get the attention of stupid people. If you've met a politician when not on stage or on camera, you'll see what I mean. Basically, the rest of the time, they are doing what is necessary to get attention and votes.

When on a sub, its best to pay attention to long-term participants and see how they spin their comments. For example, they avoid negatively-connoted vocabulary. They can also start a comment with a short high-karma sentence of one or two syllable words, knowing that most of the voters won't be reading to the end. Many users don't really understand the relation between words, but have a sum-of-words scanning method. But they don't ""see"" words longer than about two or three syllables or outside the six thousand most commonly used words in English.     

Different subs contain different catch phrases. For example, in r/Nasa, news of any achievement gets a highly-rated platitude which is ""what a time to be alive"".  So you can say something serious containing a few karma trigger words at the start. Similarly, avoid negatively-connoted words or simply agreement with a perceived adversary.

**edit:** I forgot to mention *expected* downvoting. For example I was just reading an article linked from a r/Science thread about brain MRI changes to amateur footballers. I commented to the effect that the thread title omitted to mention that it was **American** football which was the object of the study. I stated that this sport causes more collisions than ""soccer"" which is played internationally, and to different rules. I was expecting net downvotes and am getting them. This is just a knee-jerk reaction because the reader may infer the comment is from a non-American and that American football is somehow viewed as inferior.
