"M4 MacBook Pro Reviews: Processor Benchmarks Impress, New Nano-Texture Option Worth the Extra $150",53,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/m4-macbook-pro-reviews-processor-benchmarks-impress-new-nano-texture-option-worth-the-extra/,13,,"Glad to see nano texture is worth it, hope to see it irl | From MacRumors reporting from multiple M4 Macbook Pro early review sources:

> The first wave of reviews of Apple's new M4-powered MacBook Pro models were published this morning. We've collected some of the latest impressions from YouTube channels and select media outlets below.

> Apple last month announced the new 14-inch and 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, adding next-generation M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, with Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and a few other updates

Nano-texture display

> The Verge's Antonio G. Di Benedetto:

> ""As for doing my edits on the nano-texture display, I know glossy screens have a slightly deeper contrast, but I love not worrying about glare. I’m not exclusively editing in a dark room with a hooded reference monitor, and I like the flexibility of working in places with less-than-ideal lighting conditions. The convenience of the nano-texture far outweighs any slight technical advantage of a glossy display. And at $150, it’s a worthwhile upgrade for visual pros.""

> TechCrunch's Brian Heater:

> ""Simply put: If you’re buying a new Pro and plan to go outside ever, spend the additional $150. I presently have two Studio Displays on my desktop. One is nano-textured, the other isn’t. It makes a huge difference, even indoors. In fact, at one point I rearranged the two screens in a way that minimizes the glare from the one window in the room.""

> ""Glossy displays on Macs are one of those things we complained about years ago, but at a certain point, many of us were worn down by Apple’s refusal to offer an alternative over the years. I had given up on the idea years ago. Now that it’s available, I plan to get it for any MacBook I get, going forward.""

> Six Color's Jason Snell:

> ""I frequently use my laptop outside. If it’s a nice day, I will sit in my backyard under a redwood tree and write. I did so for this article, in fact, and spent some time trying to counteract the afternoon sun shining through the branches with the new screen brightness and nano-texture display.""

""The results were very good. True, not even the nano-texture display can really defeat the sun shining directly into the screen and reflecting into my eyes. But beyond that extreme condition, it defeated all other forms of glare easily. Using a nano-texture-covered display is a little weird—the reflections just stop at the screen edge, as if by magic. It works incredibly well. And most of the time, in more normal lighting conditions, I didn’t really notice the nano-texture being there. Yes, if you look closely, you will notice a light scatter that reduces contrast a bit.""

 M4 Performance

> The Verge's Antonio G. Di Benedetto:

> ""You won’t see the same performance in grueling workloads as you would if you spent a bit more to get an M4 Pro or a lot more for an M4 Max, but the standard M4 has some marked improvements over the M3. The M4 fared about 64 percent better than the M3 in Cinebench’s standard multicore test, and it maintained around a 41 percent delta when running a longer, sustained 30-minute loop of the same benchmark. It’s got two more cores than the M3 we tested, so it makes sense for the M4 to excel here, but its single-core scores in both Cinebench and Geekbench were also over 20 percent better. The machine was up to 25 percent faster in GPU benchmarks with the same number of GPU cores, too.""

> ZDNet's Kerry Wan:

> ""Unsurprisingly, the M4 MacBook Pro outperforms its predecessors, as well as some of the latest Windows machines running on Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) chipsets. It's quite spectacular to see the $1,599 M4 MacBook Pro outpacing a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip that I paid almost $3,000 for.""

> TechRadar's Lance Ulanoff:

> ""Apple is now backing all of its new Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. This pays dividends in AI (Apple Intelligence is on board) and graphically intense operations like ray tracing, which helps make games like Lies of P look incredible on the MacBook Pro 14.""

> ""In benchmark testing, I found the numbers in line with the M4 performance I saw from the iPad Pro 13 inch. Geekbench 6.3 numbers measurably exceed those of the M3 in my MacBook Air.""

> ""When I played Shadow of the Tomb Radar, Steam's internal frames per second counter showed I got anywhere between 42fps and 62fps. To my eyes, there was no tearing or dropped frames.""

> For customers choosing between the M4 Pro and M4 Max, the M4 Max appears to be up to 20% faster than the M4 Pro in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance. The M4 Max is now the fastest Apple silicon chip in the Geekbench 6 database.

Upgraded Webcam

> The Verge's Antonio G. Di Benedetto:

> ""Apple has a history of shipping disappointing webcams, even on its $1,599 Studio Display that costs as much as the M4 MacBook Pro and the just-released iPad Mini. But the MacBook Pro’s new 12MP camera has nice contrast even when I’m backlit by a window, and its Center Stage software that keeps you in frame works well enough without being overly aggressive on reframing. I can’t offer similar praise for Desk View, which uses some heavy cropping and software corrections to show a top-down view of your desk. It’s distorted and low-res, and there are myriad better ways to show and tell on a video call — including using your iPhone and Apple’s own Continuity Camera feature.""

> Engadget's Devindra Hardawar:

> ""Apple also upgraded the MacBook Pros' webcams to 12-megapixels, a major leap over the previous 1080p camera. (Apple hasn't confirmed the megapixel figure for that camera, but it's likely around 2MP, the bare minimum to reach 1080p). Having a higher resolution camera also opens the door for Center Stage, which can keep you in focus as you move around your room.""

> ""I didn't hate Apple's previous webcams, but mostly that's because I remember how mediocre its older 720p webcams used to be. The new models look far sharper with more accurate colors, and the overall image doesn't look as heavily filtered as the previous cameras. They also support Desk View (above), Apple's helpful feature for showing off objects below your screen.""

> The new ‌‌MacBook Pro‌ Models‌ can be ordered now on Apple.com and will be available in Apple Stores starting Friday. | If the nano texture is anything like Studio Display or iPad Pro, it's not just contrast you lose. You lose sharpness. The overall result is a softer viewing experience. You can also see a texture on the screen that to my eyes has a bit of a tint depending on the angle. Best way I can describe it is if you have some kind of soapy residue left on a screen, you see a kind of shimmery tint. Hard to describe. 

They're probably good for the average person. But if you care about depth of colour and detail, then you're probably still better off to go with glossy, unless these screens are somehow different than the aforementioned products.

My biggest and really only gripe is I went with the base model and am constantly running into memory issues.

This is about where my budget is. I really wished the m4 pro had a 32 gb option as I may have just ponied up a bit more for it. 48gb is too expensive at that price point

Apple Intelligence Siri voices suck — Why?,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1glbkgw/apple_intelligence_siri_voices_suck_why/,86,"Am I the only one who finds the new Siri voices a horrible step backwards?

After a few days I end up changing because earch voice ends up grating on my ears. Meanwhile, my non AI-capable iPad continues to use the old, better voice.

Sometimes Siri 4 sounds almost resentful when responding, which might be more understandable if the responses were better… ","The Irish female voice is nice | I think they’re fine, I just can’t figure out how to get Siri to stop yelling at me when a call comes in with my AirPods on…. | Yes, they are lame.

"Apple Seeds First Public Betas of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 With New Apple Intelligence Features",284,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/ios-18-2-first-public-beta/,67,,"From MacRumors:

> Apple today seeded the first public betas of upcoming iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 updates, allowing the public to try out the new features ahead of when the software launches. The public betas come a couple days after Apple provided developers with the second betas.

> Public beta testers can download the updates from the Settings app on each device after opting into the beta through Apple's public beta testing website.

> iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ introduce the next Apple Intelligence features, including the first image generation capabilities.

> The update adds Image Playground, a new app for creating images based on text descriptions. You can enter anything you want, though Apple will suggest costumes, locations, items, and more to add to an image. There are options to create characters that resemble your friends and family, and you can choose a photo for ‌Image Playground‌ to use as inspiration to create a related image. Elements added to ‌Image Playground‌ creations are previewed, and there is a preview history so you can undo a change and go back to a prior version.

> While ‌Image Playground‌ is a standalone app, it is also integrated into Messages, Notes, Freeform, and more. ‌Image Playground‌ does not make photorealistic images and is instead limited to animation or illustration styles.

> The update also adds Genmoji, which are customizable emoji characters that you can create based on descriptions and phrases. Like ‌Image Playground‌ creations, you can base them on your friends and family, with the data pulled from the People album in Photos. You can also make characters using basic elements, and you'll get multiple ‌Genmoji‌ suggestions to choose from. You can create ‌Genmoji‌ using the emoji keyboard.

> ‌Genmoji‌ are limited to iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 right now, and will be coming to ‌macOS Sequoia‌ later.

> Siri in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2 has ChatGPT integration. If ‌Siri‌ is unable to provide an answer to a question, ‌Siri‌ will hand the request over to ChatGPT, though ‌Siri‌ will need user permission first. ChatGPT will answer the question and relay the information back through ‌Siri‌.

> ChatGPT can be used to create content from scratch, including text and images. No account is required to use ChatGPT integration, and Apple and OpenAI do not store requests.

> If you have an iPhone 16, there's a Visual Intelligence feature in iOS 18.2 that provides information about what's around you. Open up the camera and point it at a restaurant to get reviews, or point it at an item to search Google for it.

> Some other Visual Intelligence capabilities include reading text out loud, detecting phone numbers and addresses to add them to Contacts, copying text, and summarizing text.

> Apple added Writing Tools in iOS 18.1, but in iOS 18.2, you can more freely describe the tone or content change that you want to make, such as adding more action words, or turning an email into a poem.

> ‌Apple Intelligence‌ now supports localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the UK in addition to U.S. English.

> If you've already been testing ‌Apple Intelligence‌ and are opted in, you will have access to Writing Tools, ChatGPT integration, and Visual Intelligence automatically.

> There is a secondary waiting list for early access to use ‌Genmoji‌, ‌Image Playground‌, and Image Wand. You can sign up to get access in ‌Image Playground‌ or in the areas where you access ‌Genmoji‌ or Image Wand.

> When you request access, you are added to a wait list for all three capabilities and you'll get a notification when the features are available for you to use. Apple will roll out access over time.

> The public betas are available on all devices, but the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features require a device capable of ‌Apple Intelligence‌.

> Apple is still working on refining the new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ tools, and the company warns that ‌Genmoji‌, Image Wand, and ‌Image Playground‌ can sometimes give you results you weren't expecting. Apple is collecting feedback on these experiences and will refine them over time.

> Apple is expected to release the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, and visionOS 2.2 updates in early December. | Note to everyone.

Because it seems like they have 120hz figured out; everything from battery drain to always-on. They've been doing it on the LCD iPad Pros since 2018.

That is to say: I highly doubt these 90hz displays will be tangibly less expensive than 120hz ones.

This feels like a very ""New Apple"" thing. Old Apple would've brought 120hz to the main line because they'd have a new and exciting display feature that adequately differentiated the pro line.

 P.S. There’s a small bug: On iOS 17, the “Dive in” button doesn’t work sometimes when the app is first launched. However, closing and reopening the app should fix this. There are no issues on iOS 18. A new update is already published and will soon be online.

I Created an App to Help Effortlessly Extend Your MacBook's Battery Life by 10-15%,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ginx2u/i_created_an_app_to_help_effortlessly_extend_your/,15,"Hello!

I'd like to introduce my first Mac app - **Dreamless**.

The concept is simple: it automatically turns off Wi-Fi/Bluetooth when your Mac goes to sleep and turns them back on when it wakes up.

You may wonder why such an app is needed. The answer is simple: it saves your MacBook's battery life, helping keep it in good condition for as long as possible. It also prevents unwanted connections/processes from running without your knowledge when your Mac is asleep.

**Features:**

\- Ability to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth separately.

\- All controls are in the menu bar - just two buttons!

\- Uses minimal resources on your Mac. Overall, the use of system resources is close to zero.

\- Option to add to auto-start.

Works on Apple Silicon and Intel. Requires macOS 13+.

**Downsides:**

\- Despite my efforts to streamline this, due to macOS security, you’ll need to enter your admin password a few times during installation. This isn't to grant access to critical system services but simply to create folders, copy a few essential files, and run the program in the background for proper functionality.

\- Disabling Wi-Fi may affect the Find My feature.

I use Dreamless daily, both with an external monitor and without any peripherals. With an external monitor, if I wake up my Mac by any means (I use a USB mouse), Bluetooth devices like the keyboard and trackpad connect in a few seconds. Without peripherals, it runs flawlessly.

In the end, I’ve created a handy utility I've been using for over a year.

For your safety, the app is signed and notarized, meaning it’s been verified by Apple for malware.

To celebrate the launch, I’m offering a **75% discount** with the promo code **APPLE**, bringing the price down to just $1. The promo code will be valid for a month, until December 3rd. All future updates will be free.

Check out the app here: [https://dreamless.app](https://dreamless.app). 

I’d love to hear your feedback.

Thanks for your attention, and have a great day.","\- Disabling Wi-Fi may affect the Find My feature.

This sounded like a really cool idea at first, but no way would I want to tamper with this. | With Apple Silicon Macs having battery lives up to 24 hours, I’m not sure there’s an obvious use-case for this app. It makes more sense for Intel Macs. 

But it would kill Power Nap, a macOS feature that requires a network connection.

Hi r/apple!

My first app is a debt and savings tracker that lets you log your debts and savings goals. The UI becomes a dashboard to monitor those debts and savings, with many charts, projections, and calculators integrated into the debts. 

All entered data is saved *only* on the device and in iCloud and is *100% private*. It doesn’t have logins or synchronization with bank accounts, it works offline and doesn’t have a signup to use. 

*Current Features:*

**Debt Manager:**

   - Log 14 types of debt in one place, including credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, and more.
   - Easily add and log debt activity, view detailed progress reports, and plan repayment with a user-friendly interface.
   - See detailed Amortization, Debt Payoff dates, and interest estimations for most debts
   - Asset metadata for Debts: log mortgages to Houses, Cars to loans, student loans to degrees, etc

**Savings Manager:**

   - Log savings goals for downpayments, emergency funds, weddings, home renovations, cars, and much more.
   - Each savings can have multiple sources of funds to log across more than one place (such as savings account, gifts from family or brokerage + savings + physical cash, etc) 
   - Some savings types allow “downpayment” logic. For example, when you save for a car/house, you can save 10,20,50,100% of the total purchase price. 

**No Data Tracking:**

   - DownPay collects no data whatsoever from users, no 3rd party ads, no analytics, etc

**No Subscription:**

   - Free, or One-time Lifetime unlock for unlimited

*Free Version:*

- Log 3 Debts
- Log 2 Savings Goals

In-App Purchases: DownPay Pro

- One-time $15
- Monthly $0.99


**New features built recently:**

- [Detailed Amortization tables & charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosapps/s/u58Mvf0LTc)

I’m looking at getting a MBP 16 for law school and after, using it until either  it’s not supported by Apple any longer or it dies. 

Generally speaking I like to buy a step or two above than what I need now and it has suited me well in the past(I greatly prefer to have power so that I never hit the ceiling, but also don’t necessarily want to buy a Ferrari when an Audi would do fine). 

I really don’t have a base, except 16gb of ram is too small for me(I was at 12-14 just using office) and I’d like to have multiple monitor support if I decide to use a dock.

What’s the general consensus of which one would be best for me? 

I was thinking m4 max with 48gb of ram. But I want to check my sanity. 

I don’t envision doing graphics design, beyond learning and messing around with photoshop or something similar. I manage networks, surf the web, and use iMazing which is or was a huge ram hog. | Old phone boot loop after erasure

"Apple expands iPhone satellite services deal, commits $1.1bn to expand capacity ",2323,https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/01/apple-expands-iphone-satellite-services-deal/,199,,"“Additionally, Apple will take 20% ownership of GlobalStar, in an equity deal worth about $400 million.” is an interesting takeaway.  | 9to5Mac reporting from Globalstar:

> Satellite services provider GlobalStar today disclosed an expansion of its deal with Apple. Apple will commit an additional $1.1 billion for upfront infrastructure prepayments, to increase the capacity of satellite services. Additionally, Apple will take 20% ownership of GlobalStar, in an equity deal worth about $400 million.

> The news has sent GlobalStar stock soaring, and it hints towards Apple’s growing plans for iPhone satellite features. With iOS 18, for instance, iPhone users are now able to send text messages to friends and family over satellite, when outside of cellular or WiFi range.

> Apple continues to commit significant financial resources to providing satellite features, while offering the feature for free to end users. However, it has repeatedly signalled that it intends to charge fees to iPhone users at some point.

> Satellite connectivity for Emergency SOS first launched with the iPhone 14 in 2022. At the time, Apple said that satellite would be free for two years. That means customers would have had to start paying around now, in late 2024. However, Apple extended the free period until 2025.

> Apple has yet to confirm how much it intends to charge for the satellite features. It’s a hairy subject as much of the current offering relies on using satellite during life-threatening emergencies, which feels rather punitive for Apple to charge for. It is possible the company will continue to offer Emergency SOS for free, while charging for other features like the ability to share location in Find My or the new iOS 18 capability to send text messages over satellite recreationally. Others have speculated satellite service may be rolled into the Apple One bundle, or be offered through mobile carrier add-ons.

> Satellite connectivity is supported on iPhone 14 and later models. Normally, satellite connectivity is only activated when outside of cellular or WiFi range.

> At least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

> All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo expects Apple to equip ""nearly all"" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip ""within about three years."" The analyst said this move would reduce Apple's component costs and further bolster Apple's hardware and software integration.

> All four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but with some limited specifications. Kuo said Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chip will support ""the latest Wi-Fi 7 spec,"" but he did not provide any further details. The chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 7nm manufacturing process known as N7, he added.

> Kuo has aligned with information shared last year by Jeff Pu, another analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro models would be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, and he said the in-house chip would expand to the entire iPhone 18 lineup the following year.

> Apple is also expected to launch its own 5G chip next year, starting in the next iPhone SE and the rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 model at a minimum.

"Unlike iPhone 16 Models, Apple's M4 Macs Lack Wi-Fi 7 Support",1074,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/,316,,"[deleted] | From MacRumors:


> Apple introduced new Mac mini, iMac, and MacBook Pro models this week, adding faster and more efficient M4 chips, along with some other updates like Thunderbolt 5 and nano-texture display options for some models. One upgrade we thought we might see was support for the latest Wi-Fi specification, but the new machines did not get a Wi-Fi 7 upgrade.

> All of the new M4 Macs continue to offer Wi-Fi 6E, and while it does allow for access to the 6GHz band on supported Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers, it's not the latest and greatest technology.

> It is surprising that Apple opted out of updating the new machines with Wi-Fi 7 because all of the iPhone 16 models that came out in September feature Wi-Fi 7 chips from Broadcom. The iPhones support the 802.11be Wi-Fi 7 standard with 2x2 MIMO, but there is a caveat with the ‌iPhone 16‌ models that takes a little bit of the sting away from not getting Wi-Fi 7 in Macs.

> Apple's Wi-Fi specifications page confirms that the Wi-Fi 7 chips in the ‌iPhone 16‌ models have a maximum physical layer data rate of 2400Mb/s and a maximum channel bandwidth of 160MHz, which is the same performance as the Wi-Fi 6E chips in the iPhone 15 Pro models and the M3 Mac models with Wi-Fi 6E on 6GHz networks (Apple's chart hasn't been updated for M4, but presumably the Wi-Fi 6E chips have not changed).

> Wi-Fi 7 in the ‌iPhone 16‌ models does up the maximum data rate when connected to 5GHz bands compared to the Wi-Fi 6E chips used in Macs and iPads, but Apple does not support the full 320MHz bandwidth with its Wi-Fi 7 implementation. Wi-Fi 7 offers up to 320MHz bandwidth to accommodate more devices, but Apple has limited bandwidth to 160MHz, so ‌iPhone 16‌ models don't take full advantage of Wi-Fi 7 despite having a Wi-Fi 7 chip. That limitation has been a disappointment, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ models do support Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for connecting to multiple bands at the same time for faster data transmission and lower latency on supported networks.

> Apple certainly could have opted for a Wi-Fi 7 chip without limitations in the M4 Mac models, especially for the more expensive M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, but that didn't happen.

Apple Intelligence Summarizes... Itself!,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1gg25cq/apple_intelligence_summarizes_itself/,3,"So, my first test of Apple Intelligence on MacBook was with Pages. I used the privacy statement about apple intelligence, and formatted it for conciseness. It came back with:

    Apple Intelligence, a generative AI system, aids with daily tasks. It helps rewrite emails, proofread notes, summarize missed messages, create memories in Photos, and generate images. Apple Intelligence delivers personalized intelligence without collecting personal data.
    
    To provide a customized experience, Apple Intelligence uses device information, including calendar events and frequently used apps, to identify the necessary data for generative models. Apple Intelligence runs models on-device to complete tasks without data leaving the device, like email summaries. However, for complex tasks, Apple Intelligence sends requests to Private Cloud Compute, a server-based intelligence system that handles more demanding requests while protecting privacy.
    
    When you initiate an Apple Intelligence task, your device analyzes if it can complete it locally. If not, Apple Intelligence uses Private Cloud Compute to send only relevant data to Apple silicon servers for processing. The data is not stored or accessible to Apple and is processed only to fulfill your request, after which it’s securely returned to your device. Apple collects limited information about requests, such as size, features used, and completion time, but not content or returned results. This data doesn’t identify you or link to your Apple Account or other data from other Apple services.
    
    To see how your data is processed, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report, turn on Record Apple Intelligence Activity, and export a file after requests.

But it was even more cool to see the ""friendly"" re-write:

    Apple Intelligence is a suite of AI models that make your daily tasks a breeze. It can help you rewrite or proofread your emails and notes, summarize your missed messages, create custom memories in Photos, generate images, and more. The best part? Apple Intelligence doesn’t collect your personal data to provide personalized intelligence.
    
    To give you a tailored experience, Apple Intelligence uses info on your device, like your upcoming calendar events and frequently used apps. It figures out what data it needs from your device to help you out without storing that data on Apple’s servers.
    
    When possible, Apple Intelligence models run entirely on your device, so you can complete tasks without your data leaving your device. For instance, when Apple Intelligence gives you preview summaries of your emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models. But there are times when Apple Intelligence needs a model that requires more power than your device can provide. In those cases, Apple Intelligence sends your request to Private Cloud Compute. Private Cloud Compute is a server-based intelligence system that can handle more complex requests while keeping your privacy safe. For example, when you use Writing Tools to proofread or edit an email, your device might send the email to Private Cloud Compute for a server-based model to do the proofreading or editing.
    
    When you start an Apple Intelligence task, your device’s built-in model checks if it can handle the task on your device. If not, Apple Intelligence uses Private Cloud Compute to send only the data needed for your request to Apple silicon servers. The data stays on Apple’s servers and isn’t shared with anyone else. It’s only used to process your request, and then it’s sent back to your device securely. Apple doesn’t keep it or use it for anything else. When your device sends a request to Private Cloud Compute, Apple only collects some basic info about the request, like how big it is and how long it takes. This info doesn’t include any details about what you asked for or what the answer was. It’s not linked to your Apple Account or any other data Apple might have from your other Apple services.
    
    You can turn on transparency logging for Apple Intelligence on your device to see how your data is processed. Just go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report and turn on Record Apple Intelligence Activity. After you make a request, you can also save a copy of the data that was processed.

Apple 2030: The M4 Mac mini is Apple’s first carbon neutral Mac,859,https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/29/the-m4-mac-mini-is-apples-first-carbon-neutral-mac/,149,,">100 percent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 percent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 percent of shipping without the use of air transportation. These combined efforts result in at least a 75 percent reduction in product emissions for each model. The company will use high-quality carbon credits to address the small amount of remaining emissions, resulting in a carbon neutral product footprint.

So it's far from being just carbon credits.

And while yes, most carbon credit schemes are bullshit,  the carbon credits Apple are buying are better than most.

>Apple defines high-quality credits as those from projects that are real, additional, measurable, and quantified, with systems in place to avoid double-counting, and that ensure permanence. Apple has helped advance natural carbon-removal solutions that meet this definition by creating the innovative [Restore Fund](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/04/apple-expands-innovative-restore-fund-for-carbon-removal/), which currently supports projects in Latin America. The company uses credits from projects that are certified to international standards such as Verra; the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards; and the Forest Stewardship Council.

It's easy to knock companies when they try to do the right thing. If you look at what Apple has been doing over the years it's clear that this is more than just lip-service. Someone at the heart of Apple really believes in this stuff. *Way* more than most other tech companies.

iPhone 16 now banned in Indonesia over Apple’s unfulfilled investment commitments,993,https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/27/iphone-16-indonesia-ban/,232,,"What's really shitty about Indonesia as an expat.

From memory the additional tax was around up to 40% of the phone price.

Indonesia is being quite greedy. | Banning the *USE* of iphone 16? How do you even enforce that?! | From the article: Earlier this week, the Indonesian government has banned the sale and use of iPhone 16 models in the country, alongside other Apple products released this fall, including the Apple Watch Series 10. The ban occurred because Apple failed to meet some of its investment commitments in the country (via The Economic Times).

This ban covers both the sale and operation of iPhone 16 models and extends to units already sold, creating issues for tourists. Industry Minister Gumiwang Kartasasmita stated the following:

*If there is an iPhone 16 that can operate in Indonesia, that means that I can say, the device is illegal. Do report it to us.*

The reason for this ban is because the country would like to force Apple to fulfill its investment promises in the nation. Apple apparently pledged $109 million USD ($1.71 trillion rupiah) for investments in Indonesia’s infrastructure and local sourcing, but has come up short on their promise, at roughly $95 million USD ($1.48 trillion rupiah).",whats really shitty indonesia expat purchase phone overseas enter country need pay additional imei tax phone memory additional tax around phone price indonesia quite greedy banning use iphone even enforce article earlier week indonesian government banned sale use iphone model country alongside apple product released fall including apple watch series ban occurred apple failed meet investment commitment country via economic time ban cover sale operation iphone model extends unit already sold creating issue tourist industry minister gumiwang kartasasmita stated following iphone operate indonesia mean say device illegal report u reason ban country would like force apple fulfill investment promise nation apple apparently pledged million usd trillion rupiah investment indonesia infrastructure local sourcing come short promise roughly million usd trillion rupiah

Narwhal 2 for Reddit now has settings sync and better GIF/video handling!,328,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1gde7bl/narwhal_2_for_reddit_now_has_settings_sync_and/,168,"Hey all, I'm the dev of Narwhal 2 for Reddit. I've been continually trying to make my passion project better over time and I just released another large update. I still have so many things to work on, but your feedback is invaluable to me as I try to make the best possible app for Reddit. Thanks for all of your support!

### New Features 

- GIFs/Videos in Big Preview Mode will only start playing when they are mostly on screen. No more scrolling and seeing GIFs that are already halfway done playing!
- Settings (including themes!) are now synced to your iCloud account so that if you get a new device or have to re-install, everything will still be customized to your liking.
- Adds setting to automatically unmute GIFs/videos in Big Preview mode as you scroll in Settings > Posts
- Adds favorites button as an option for the action bar
- Adds setting to control mute behavior on GIF posts
- App icons will now respond correctly to dark mode. I also added a new orangered and new blue icon.
- Adds setting to control the gesture for how comments are collapsed: single tap, double tap, two finger tap, or disabled altogether

### Improved

- When opening a GIF/Video from Big Preview Mode, the post will show the GIF/Video at the same place on the timeline. For those of you who may not like this behavior, there is now a setting to always start GIFs/Videos from the beginning in Settings > Posts
- GIFs and videos that are unmuted in Big Preview mode will stay un-muted when you open the post

### Fixed

- Fixes issue where iOS dictation would insert a weird character that is displayed on reddit.com
- Changed some icons for the action bar to ensure continuity in the visual style
- Fixes issue where placeholders would be shown with thumbnails turned off

If anyone has any questions around Narwhal 2, iOS programming, what it's like to work on an app like this, etc., I am happy to answer!

I’m excited to announce a major update for Zesfy, a productivity that app I’ve been developing over the past few years. This app is designed to seamlessly integrate your tasks with your calendar, allowing you to transform your to-do lists into actionable events in just seconds. Here are some of its key features:

* **Task Progress:** Automatically update your progress based on subtasks completed
* **Step:** Create step-by-step breakdown of the subtask
* **Target:** Organize tasks with due date
* **Session:** Insert multiple tasks to calendar event
* **Space:** Filter event from specific sets of calendars

This update introduces new features that often missing from other productivity apps: the ability to set both “Do” and “Due” dates. With these features, you can effortlessly plan your tasks for the day while keeping track the upcoming due dates. What makes Zesfy unique is it separates tasks you’ve planned and those that are already scheduled in your calendar, giving you a more organized and flexible workflow. 

Let me know what your thought about these new features.
