I just can't anymore. Such a bummer. | Just had the worst customer experience ever. I'm not completely done with Amazon but will definitely be changing my buying habits.

Amazon sent me a used bathtub spout, missing parts. I contacted support and they said they would refund me, no need to return the item. Over week goes buy and I see no refund.

I told him it could be a ""true promise"" if he just honors the original agreement. The new guy would not even consider it. I can't believe I would have been stuck with this item with no refund if I had not been keeping careful watch on my checking account.

A very weak apology from the chat and I told him that I would definitely be shopping elsewhere because of this. Guy did not care but he's probably trained not to care.

Amazon seems to taking a new approach with customer service.

It seems like they might be using AI to give cs reps prompts to respond to customers now?

In the last 24 hours, I spoke to 11 cs reps about an item that was supposed to canceled (app said it was canceled, cs rep confirmed it was canceled) — but then progressed to “shipped.”

Not only were they DMV-level apathetic and impersonal, but they were bizarrely incompetent?  Kept answering my very straightforward questions with rote responses that didn’t pertain to my questions — as if some Al prompt was directing them to scripted replies for “Frequently Asked Questions.”

It got to the point where it was so bizarre I thought I was living in a Black Mirror episode. I started out my convo with the last rep (a supervisor) by explaining that she was now the 11th rep I’d spoken to and pleading with her to listen to my question because I kept getting irrelevant responses and then getting transferred.

So l posed my question...... and she responded with yet another completely irrelevant answer 🤯

Me: “I’m hoping to get refunded for this time as soon as possible.  Is there anything I can do on my end to make that process go faster?  Does it make a difference whether I return it via UPS or Whole Foods?  Is one of them faster?”

Her:  “Yes, your item is arriving Wednesday and then you can return it.”

I purchased an iPhone for work.

The phone gave me problems from the get-go, as I spent hours explaining myself to the support staff. I went to the Apple store 4 or 5 times with various problems

* the phone would overheat and shut down
* the volume and microphone did not work, so I missed calls
* the camera stopped working
* couldn't make calls even though I had network coverage

The man at the Apple store said sometimes you make a bad phone, and it is best to get a replacement. As I have been there so many times, he recognized me. On the last visit, he had to replace the camera.

I contacted Amazon, and the supervisor on the 10th promised me that I could return the item for a full refund.

Unfortunately, due to health reasons, I had to travel and was unable to return the item, but was forced to purchase a new iPhone.

When I knew I had to travel, I contacted Amazon and asked them if I could return it upon my return, and they said yes, no problem, aiming to return this on the 20th.

So when I returned, which was 3 days ago, I contacted Amazon to arrange this return.

The support and treatment I received was a disgrace, 3 different operators disconnected from the chat without helping me. One cancelled the original return and created a repair ticket, and the supervisors seemed to care little about the fact that Amazon promised me a return and refund for this item.

So now I have 2 phones and Amazon is refusing to agree to what they promised me, their excuse was that the return ticket was cancelled (by their staff) and it can only be created once

I have emails, chats showing what they promised me, and now they are ignoring the fact of what they promised.

Not to mention since this event, I tried to speak to Amazon on various occasions and they disconnected from the chat 5 times

I was told that I can only send this in for repair.

I have 1100 less in my account now due to Amazon cheating me.

can anyone offer any advise

My SSD died, last night, so I ordered a replacement with a delivery of ""Today from 5p - 10p"".

While tracking it, the update changed to ""8:30 - 9:30"". 

* 8:00 - Drive is 9 stops away
* 8:10 - Driver is 8 stops away (on the map, 3 miles away)
* 8:20 - We lost track of the driver. Still by 9:30
* 9:30 - We lost track of the driver. Still by 10:00
* 10:01 - Out for delivery. Sorry we're late.
* 11:00 (now) - Out for delivery. Sorry we're late.

Does this happen often?

Did she just decide to go home?

It's late and I'm exhausted but don't want the box to sit out all night. How long do I stay up and wait for this?

Plus, I'm without a working computer until this arrives.

GRRRRRRRR.... | Used catbox?

I bought a PETKIT puramax catbox from Amazon, it was delivered in a ""UPS Store"" box.  I opened it and it contained dirty laundry, and a used regular cat box that still had litter and cat waste inside.  

Naturally I was upset so I called Amazon customer service and initially they just said oh we can ""help process a return"".  I said that wasn't good enough you shipped a biohazard into my home and I want it gone.  So they scheduled next day pickup with UPS, and they picked it up yesterday. 

This morning Amazon sent an email that they have issued an ""advanced refund"", and that pending receipt they may charge my card if it's the wrong item.  Well of course it's the wrong item but it's the wrong item that I was sent.
