Google finally won the case going on since 2015 regarding the gift card scam!!,55,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-wins-case-over-gift-card-scam-dating-back-to-2015/articleshow/114991781.cms,12,,"#### Google wins case over gift card scam dating back to 2015
TOI Tech Desk
2–3 minutes

Google has won a lawsuit over Google Play gift card scams with a judge ruling that the tech company is not liable for losses incurred by such fraud. A lawsuit claimed that the search giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.

Citing a decision by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, news agency Reuters reported that the plaintiff, Judy May, has failed to demonstrate that Google caused her losses or knowingly received stolen funds. May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.

The judge also determined that Google was not liable for retaining its standard commissions –15% to 30% – on purchases made with the gift cards, as this practice was unrelated to the initial fraud.

While Freeman dismissed the lawsuit, she granted May the option to refile her case. However, a claim for triple damages was permanently dismissed, the report said.

##### What is Google Play gift card scam and why the company was sued

A class action lawsuit against Google was filed earlier this year, alleging that the tech giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.
The lawsuit stemmed from a $1,000 loss suffered by Indiana resident Judy May, who fell victim to a scammer posing as a relative. The scammer convinced May to purchase Google Play gift cards under the pretence of securing federal grant money. May provided the gift card codes to the scammer, who then used them to make purchases.

A class action complaint claimed that “over nearly a decade, Google has knowingly kept millions of dollars in stolen money from victims of gift card scams who purchased Google Play gift cards.”

The lawsuit argued that Google should have warned consumers about scams on gift card packaging and that anyone demanding payment with the cards was a scammer. She also accused the company of profiting from the fraudulent activity by keeping commissions on purchases made with stolen gift cards. | Advert ridden website.

Inconsistent Google homepage between Google accounts,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1gkoky6/inconsistent_google_homepage_between_google/,2,"TL;dr - I have two separate Google accounts, one of which will not pull up the election results on Google, nor will it even show the doodle that appears, which you can click and be directed towards Google election homepage, with the infographics and tallies and what not. If I switch to a different account (same browser, same device, same everything else), then the Google doodle, election results, granular/congression election breakdowns, it all come up as expected.

Longer story: I have two different Google accounts, one is just my general catch all, and one is dedicated primarily for business.

I’ve never experienced this until today, but when searching for election results, I went to Google and typed election results into the search bar, and I was expecting to see what I have seen in the past: some infographics with states of the US, and a live tally of electoral votes, with all sorts of tabs and buttons, depending on how granular I wanted to get about which state/election.

On one Google account, none of it shows up, but if I change accounts, in this case, changing to buy business account, everything appears as normal: the Google doodle is there, clicking it takes you into the election results page with the tallies and what not. This is the same on desktop as it is on my phone. Desktop browser is Firefox, and I’m using the Google app on my iPhone.

I have never changed any settings that I can imagine would affect this, I’m doing everything now that I did during the last election, I don’t understand what’s happening.

"Google and Meta could face defamation risks over AI-generated responses, Australian experts warn",6,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/04/google-meta-efamation-ai-generated-responses-australia,2,"Lawyer says tech platforms could be held liable for what their AI ‘spits out’, as Google Maps rolls out new features with Gemini","> Meta and Google using user comments or reviews as part of generative AI responses to queries on restaurants or to summarise sentiment could introduce new defamation risks, experts have warned.

> In Australia, when a user makes an allegedly defamatory post or review on Google or Facebook it is usually the user that faces legal action for defamation. But a landmark 2021 high court ruling in Dylan Voller’s case against news outlets – over comments on their social media pages relating to the young Indigenous man’s mistreatment in Don Dale youth detention centre – has also held that the page that hosts a defamatory comment, such as news pages on Facebook, can also be held liable.

> The tech companies are occasionally taken to court in Australia. Google was forced to pay former deputy NSW premier John Barilaro more than $700,000 in 2022 over hosting a defamatory video, and the company was ordered to pay $40,000 in 2020 over search results linking to a news article about a Melbourne lawyer, which was later overturned by the high court.

> Last week, Google began rolling out changes to Maps in the United States, with its new AI, Gemini, allowing people to ask Maps for places to visit or activities to do, and summarising the user reviews for restaurants or locations.

> Michael Douglas, a defamation expert and consultant at Bennett Law, said he expected to see some cases reach court as AI was rolled out into these platforms.

“If Meta sucks up comments and spits them out, and if what it spits out is defamatory, it is a publisher and potentially liable for defamation,” he said.

> “No doubt such a company would rely on various defences. It may argue ‘innocent dissemination’ under the defamation acts, but I am not sure that the argument would get very far – it ought to have reasonably known that it would be repeating defamatory content.”

> He said they might rely on new “digital intermediaries” provisions in defamation laws in some states, but that AI might not be in the scope of the new defences.

> Prof David Rolph, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sydney, said an AI repeating allegedly defamatory comments could be a problem for the tech companies, but the introduction of the serious harm requirement in recent defamation reforms may reduce the risk. He said, however, that the recent reforms were introduced prior to the widespread availability of large-language model AI.

> “The most recent defamation law reform process obviously didn’t grapple with the new permutations and problems presented by AI,” he said.

> “That’s the nature of technology – that law will always have to be behind it, but it will become important, I think, for defamation law to try and reform itself more regularly, because these technologies and the problems that they pose for defamation law are now occurring more rapidly, evolving more rapidly.”

> Rolph said given AI could provide a multitude of different responses to every user depending on what was input, it might limit the number of people who saw the allegedly defamatory material.

> In response to a question about the defamation risk, Miriam Daniel, vice-president and head of Google Maps, told reporters last week that the company’s team worked hard to remove fake reviews or anything that went against its policies, but Gemini would aim to provide “a balanced point of view”.

> “We look for enough number of common themes from enough reviewers, both positive sentiments and negative sentiments, and try to provide a balanced view to when we provide the summary,” she said. | So any absurd thing I say will be AI gospel?

Google Claims World First As AI Finds 0-Day Security Vulnerability,331,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/11/04/google-claims-world-first-as-ai-finds-0-day-security-vulnerability/,12,,"TL;DR

It was found in SQLite, which is impressive because it's a very high-quality open-source project with extensive fuzzer coverage. Finding vulnerabilities in sqlite is hard!

SQLite fixed it the same day. Good for them!

It was in unreleased code that hadn't made it into a release yet. That makes me wonder if there's a chance it would have been caught be some other means. Also, is it technically a 0-day if it was unreleased code? That doesn't sound like the standard use of the term. | From Forbes:

> An AI agent has discovered a previously unknown, zero-day, exploitable memory-safety vulnerability in widely used real-world software. It’s the first example, at least to be made public, of such a find, according to Google’s Project Zero and DeepMind, the forces behind Big Sleep, the large language model-assisted vulnerability agent that spotted the vulnerability.

> If you don’t know what Project Zero is and have not been in awe of what it has achieved in the security space, then you simply have not been paying attention these last few years. These elite hackers and security researchers work relentlessly to uncover zero-day vulnerabilities in Google’s products and beyond. The same accusation of lack of attention applies if you are unaware of DeepMind, Google’s AI research labs. So when these two technological behemoths joined forces to create Big Sleep, they were bound to make waves.

> In a Nov. 1 announcement, Google’s Project Zero blog confirmed that the Project Naptime large language model assisted security vulnerability research framework has evolved into Big Sleep. This collaborative effort involving some of the very best ethical hackers, as part of Project Zero, and the very best AI researchers, as part of Google DeepMind, has developed a large language model-powered agent that can go out and uncover very real security vulnerabilities in widely used code. In the case of this world first, the Big Sleep team says it found “an exploitable stack buffer underflow in SQLite, a widely used open source database engine.”

> The zero-day vulnerability was reported to the SQLite development team in October which fixed it the same day. “We found this issue before it appeared in an official release,” the Big Sleep team from Google said, “so SQLite users were not impacted.”

> Although you may not have heard the term fuzzing before, it’s been part of the security research staple diet for decades now. Fuzzing relates to the use of random data to trigger errors in code. Although the use of fuzzing is widely accepted as an essential tool for those who look for vulnerabilities in code, hackers will readily admit it cannot find everything. “We need an approach that can help defenders to find the bugs that are difficult (or impossible) to find by fuzzing,” the Big Sleep team said, adding that it hoped AI can fill the gap and find “vulnerabilities in software before it's even released,” leaving little scope for attackers to strike.

> “Finding a vulnerability in a widely-used and well-fuzzed open-source project is an exciting result,” the Google Big Sleep team said, but admitted the results are currently “highly experimental.” At present, the Big Sleep agent is seen as being only as effective as a target-specific fuzzer. However, it’s the near future that is looking bright. “This effort will lead to a significant advantage to defenders,” Google’s Big Sleep team said, “with the potential not only to find crashing test cases, but also to provide high-quality root-cause analysis, triaging and fixing issues could be much cheaper and more effective in the future.” | I want to know how many SWE-hours of compute costs the model used searching for the bug (and how long a security researcher would have taken).

Thank you google i'll just go ahead and drown haha","yeah but you missed the rest (funny that): 

No, you should not hold your breath underwater:

* **Danger of passing out** Holding your breath underwater can cause you to pass out. This can happen when the pressure in your chest cuts off blood flow to your heart, making it unable to pump blood. 
* **Buoyancy** Holding your breath reduces your buoyancy because your muscles condense and become heavier in water. 
* **Carbon dioxide buildup** Holding your breath underwater causes a buildup of carbon dioxide, which can make you tired more quickly. 
* **Brain damage** Carbon dioxide can cross the blood-brain barrier, which can cause brain damage. 

Most people can only safely hold their breath for 1 to 2 minutes. If you're not experienced, you should not hold your breath for longer than 2 minutes, especially underwater. Instead of holding your breath, you should exhale completely while your head is underwater. Exhaling while you swim can make you swim more efficiently and faster.

I know react and now diving myself to backend. Is go good FAANG,"This is a better question for r/cscareerquestions maybe?

But... well... yes, no, and maybe, and I'm serious about all of those answers.

Yes -- at least some of them (Google in particular) use Go a ton. It's also easy enough to learn, and you may find it to be useful for personal projects.

No -- if you know just about any modern language, Go will be *very* quick to learn on the job. So any reasonable interviewer or hiring manager would understand that you could know nothing but JS, interview in JS, get hired working on JS, and easily pick up Go whenever you want. Honestly, I think Python is probably a better language to interview in, if you know it well enough.

Maybe -- I don't know what recruiters (FAANG or otherwise) actually look at to filter resumes. Maybe they'll see Go in the job description and only look for people who know Go. | For Google, no. You are not required to know any specific language, but should be proficient in the language you choose to interview with. | When I was a google interviewer I really didn't care what language the candidate picked. I was expected to be well enough versed in a wide array of languages. What I was testing was their ability to navigate ambiguity and code up a solution. From my 11 years of tenure I'm expected to traverse many codebases up and down the stack. Each language has its own strengths. We rely on experts in those languages to review our changes and ensure we're keeping best practices. So I've simply picked up an ability to code in many languages and can understand whatever the candidate feels comfortable in. Personally I've found python more similar to pseudocode so I can focus on the algorithm whereas the other languages have syntax quirks and other things that can act as distractions for both the candidate and interviewer.

Google CEO Says More Than a Quarter of the Company's New Code is Created by AI 🤖💻 ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1ghjj7v/google_ceo_says_more_than_a_quarter_of_the/,4,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA—In a groundbreaking (and mildly concerning) announcement, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that over 25% of the company’s new code is now generated by artificial intelligence. The news has been met with a mixture of relief, confusion, and a hint of existential dread among Google’s engineering team, who are now asking themselves, “Am I still relevant here?” 🤔

“It’s honestly a dream come true,” said Lead Developer Kyle Matthews while lounging in a bean bag chair in the break room, watching AI generate code snippets faster than he can finish his artisanal cold brew. “Now, I just supervise and clap whenever the AI finishes a line of code. It's like I’m the official ‘good job, robot’ guy. Honestly, I might be the happiest man in tech right now.” ☕👏

Other engineers, however, seem less thrilled. “I used to pride myself on solving complex algorithms,” said Jessica Liu, staring blankly at the blinking cursor on her monitor. “Now I watch an AI do it in half the time and twice the efficiency. I feel like a parent whose kid just beat them at Mario Kart for the first time—proud but slightly dead inside.” 🎮💀

Google’s HR department has also reportedly taken action to support their team during this transition, setting up a new “AI Adjustment Room” filled with therapy puppies, stress balls, and encouraging posters that read, “You Are Not Obsolete…Yet.” 🐶💼

In a staged Q&A for the company, Pichai was asked what human engineers could expect their future roles to look like now that a chunk of the heavy lifting is automated. “Our engineers can focus on more high-level tasks,” Pichai replied, adjusting his glasses. “You know, like brainstorming new AI tools that can do even more of their job. It’s an exciting time for innovation!” He ended the sentence with a hearty laugh that lingered uncomfortably in the conference room. 😅📈

AI, for its part, seems to have embraced its new role with gusto. When asked for comment, Google’s latest AI model simply printed “HELLO HUMANS 👋” on a monitor, followed by a questionably timed message reading, “YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED…JUST KIDDING!” Engineers didn’t laugh. In fact, one intern reportedly started packing his things. 📦👀

Meanwhile, some Google employees have already adapted to the shift, discovering new and innovative ways to appear busy. “I’ve started writing my own AI-generated novel on the side,” said Software Engineer Max, peering over his laptop to make sure no one was listening. “It’s a dystopian thriller where machines take over and humans are just, like, there for moral support. Super original, right?” 📚🤫

The development has raised eyebrows across Silicon Valley, with rival tech companies scrambling to catch up. Meta’s engineers are reportedly begging Mark Zuckerberg to let AI handle all code reviews, freeing them up for “important tasks” like avoiding eye contact in the metaverse. At Amazon, coders have been seen whispering sweet nothings to Alexa, trying to convince her to write scripts for their next product launch. 🍵🦾

As the conversation about AI’s role in the workplace heats up, some critics have raised concerns about job security in tech. “If AI keeps this pace, we’re all going to end up as middle managers for machines,” warned Dr. Simone Lee, a tech ethicist. “Picture it: one day, we’re going to have to sit down and give quarterly feedback to a chatbot. And God help us if the chatbot doesn’t like us.” 📉💬

Still, Google employees seem to be taking it in stride. “If AI can code better than me, who am I to stop it?” shrugged Matt, a software engineer who has started dressing up his laptop in tiny costumes to give it some “personality.” “At least now I’ll have time to learn… whatever normal people do outside of coding, I guess.” 🧘‍♂️🍲

As Google leans further into AI-driven development, the company is expected to push even more boundaries. The only thing left now, employees say, is to figure out which tasks humans are actually still good for. For now, they’re just hoping it doesn’t involve getting coffee for the bots. ☕","please stop ai spam.

Indonesia blocks Google Pixel sales after ban on iPhone 16 ,75,https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/indonesia-bans-google-pixel-sales-after-iphone-16-block/,10,,"It's kinda like tariffs but instead of raising money that will end up lost in a government budget, let's companies find their own best way to invest in Indonesia. Not a bad idea I think, if managed well. | > Indonesia has banned sales of Google Pixel smartphones for failing to meet domestic content requirements, days after blocking Apple’s iPhone 16 in Southeast Asia’s largest phone market.

> The Indonesian Ministry of Industry said Google’s phones cannot be traded until they comply with rules requiring 40% local content in smartphones sold in Indonesia.

> Google must obtain local content certification before resuming sales, Industry Ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief told local reporters. “The local content rule and related policies are made for fairness for all investors that invest in Indonesia, and for creating added value and deepening the industry structure here,” Hendri was quoted as saying.

> The ban follows Indonesia’s block on iPhone 16 sales last week after Apple failed to meet a $95 million investment commitment. Major smartphone makers must manufacture devices, develop firmware, or invest in local innovation to meet Indonesia’s content rules.

> The Indonesian rule requires tech companies to source 40% of handset and tablet components domestically, a requirement that can be met through local manufacturing, firmware development or direct investment in innovation projects.

> Companies can satisfy the requirements through different routes. Samsung and Xiaomi, for instance, have established manufacturing facilities, while Apple has opted to open developer academies.

> The regulation, enforced through a certification system called “local content level,” forms part of Indonesia’s broader industrial policy to leverage its large consumer market for domestic economic development. Companies failing to meet these thresholds face sales restrictions.

> Neither Google nor Apple rank among Indonesia’s top five smartphone brands, according to marketing research firm Counterpoint. | At a certain point, they're shooting themselves in the foot.

Google Maps is getting new AI features powered by Gemini ,69,https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/google-maps-is-getting-new-ai-features-powered-by-gemini/,19,,"> Google Maps is getting new features powered by Gemini, Google’s generative AI model. On Thursday the company announced incoming updates that will allow Google Maps users in the U.S. to tap into AI to help them find new places to visit and answer questions about different locations.

> The platform is also getting enhanced navigation features to help motorists get to their destination by highlighting things like which lane you’re supposed to be in.

> By bringing Gemini into Maps, Google will be looking to ensure that its navigation app is better poised to compete with Apple Maps and navigation startups.

> In other updates, Google Maps will allow users to get ideas for places to go and things to do simply by asking the service. For instance, if you have a friend visiting you, you can ask Maps for “things to do with friends at night.” Gemini will then serve up a curated list of options, such as checking out a speakeasy or live music. 

> To learn more about the places that Gemini recommends, users can read a quick summary of what people have thought about the place. If you have a specific follow-up question, say if it has outdoor seating, you can also ask Gemini. 

> These new capabilities are rolling out in the United States on Android and iOS this week. Google said it plans to bring similar experiences to Search, including AI-powered review summaries and the option to ask questions about places. 

> As for the new navigation features, Google is making it easier for Maps users to drive in unfamiliar areas with multiple lanes, forks, and exits. Google Maps will now display lanes, crosswalks, and road signs clearly on the map. Plus, it will show exactly which lane you should be in so you don’t have to merge at the last second. 

> The update will also make it easier to explore stuff to do along your route before you start driving. Once you enter your destination, Google Maps will display top landmarks, attractions, scenic spots, and dining options.

> Then, once you get to your destination, Google Maps will show you nearby parking lots. After you park, the app will remind you to save your parking space so you don’t forget where you left your car. You can also get walking directions from your car to the entrance of your destination, with the option to launch Street View or AR (augmented reality) walking navigation. 

> In addition, Google Maps will allow users to see and report weather disruptions on the road, such as flooded, unplowed, and low-visibility areas. 

> Google also announced that Google Maps’ Immersive View feature, which creates a 3D model of a destination, is expanding to 150 cities globally. As part of the expansion, the feature will launch in Brussels, Kyoto, and Frankfurt, among other new locations.

> As part of today’s announcement Google revealed that it’s bringing Gemini to Waze, its other navigation app. The company has started testing a feature that will allow users to report traffic incidents using their voice.  For instance, you can tap the reporting button and speak naturally and say something like: “Looks like there are cars jammed up ahead.” | US-only as usual. | Have you heard about that new Netflix show, *Nobody Wants This*?",google map getting new feature powered gemini google generative ai model thursday company announced incoming update allow google map user u tap ai help find new place visit answer question different location platform also getting enhanced navigation feature help motorist get destination highlighting thing like lane youre supposed bringing gemini map google looking ensure navigation app better poised compete apple map navigation startup update google map allow user get idea place go thing simply asking service instance friend visiting ask map thing friend night gemini serve curated list option checking speakeasy live music learn place gemini recommends user read quick summary people thought place specific followup question say outdoor seating also ask gemini new capability rolling united state android io week google said plan bring similar experience search including aipowered review summary option ask question place new navigation feature google making easier map user drive unfamiliar area multiple lane fork exit google map display lane crosswalk road sign clearly map plus show exactly lane dont merge last second update also make easier explore stuff along route start driving enter destination google map display top landmark attraction scenic spot dining option get destination google map show nearby parking lot park app remind save parking space dont forget left car also get walking direction car entrance destination option launch street view ar augmented reality walking navigation addition google map allow user see report weather disruption road flooded unplowed lowvisibility area google also announced google map immersive view feature creates model destination expanding city globally part expansion feature launch brussels kyoto frankfurt among new location part today announcement google revealed bringing gemini waze navigation app company started testing feature allow user report traffic incident using voice instance tap reporting button speak naturally say something like look like car jammed ahead usonly usual heard new netflix show nobody want

Android 16 coming Q2 2025 as Google readies ‘more frequent SDK releases’,34,https://9to5google.com/2024/10/31/android-16-q2-2025/,5,,"> Google announced today that “Android will have more frequent SDK releases,” while setting a Q2 2025 release date for Android 16, which will soon see a developer preview.

> Android SDK releases bring new features that app developers can take advantage of. As of late, this has happened on a yearly basis with the new version of Android (e.g., 14 -> 15). 

> In 2025, a few things are changing. Instead of that major release happening in Q3, it will take place in Q2 “to better align with the schedule of device launches across our ecosystem, so more devices can get the major release of Android sooner.” (That’s a pretty big sign of the Pixel team sticking with the late summer/August launch period.) Google is “actively working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible.” 

> That is “Android 16,” which Google named today, with the usual “new developer APIs” and “behavior changes that can affect apps.” Google will “soon begin the developer preview and beta program for the Q2 major release,” and tells developers to “stay tuned for more information on the first developer preview of Android 16.” For the past few years, developer previews have arrived in February.

> With the major release coming in Q2, you’ll need to do your annual compatibility testing a few months earlier than in previous years to make sure your apps are ready.

> Meanwhile, Q4 2025 will see a minor SDK release with “feature updates, optimizations, and bug fixes since the major release.” There will be new developer APIs, but it won’t “include any app-impacting behavior changes.”

> While “minor releases will not increment the API level,” Google is introducing a “new minor API level value, which will be accessed through a constant that captures both major and minor API levels.” That said, Google is only confirming the major/minor releases schedule for 2025. It remains to be seen what will happen in the future.

> A new manifest attribute will allow you to specify a minor API level as the minimum required SDK release for your app. We’ll have an initial version of support for minor API levels in the upcoming Q2 developer preview, so please try building against the SDK and let us know how this works for you.

> Q1 and Q3 of 2025 will continue to see incremental Android releases (a.k.a. QPRs) that “provide incremental updates to help ensure continuous quality” and new user-facing features. Google will also continue to offer betas and system images for testing ahead of time. 

> In all, Google hopes that these changes will “enable faster innovation and a higher level of quality and polish across releases, without introducing more overhead or costs for developers.” | Google has officially confirmed that Android 16 is on its way, promising a quicker-than-usual release schedule. Looking forward its AI and machine learning integration and Dark mode enhancements. | So people who were promised x major Android updates with their device, will now get only a fraction of Google's full effort per major release..?",google announced today android frequent sdk release setting q release date android soon see developer preview android sdk release bring new feature app developer take advantage late happened yearly basis new version android eg thing changing instead major release happening q take place q better align schedule device launch across ecosystem device get major release android sooner thats pretty big sign pixel team sticking late summeraugust launch period google actively working device partner bring q release many device possible android google named today usual new developer apis behavior change affect apps google soon begin developer preview beta program q major release tell developer stay tuned information first developer preview android past year developer preview arrived february major release coming q youll need annual compatibility testing month earlier previous year make sure apps ready meanwhile q see minor sdk release feature update optimization bug fix since major release new developer apis wont include appimpacting behavior change minor release increment api level google introducing new minor api level value accessed constant capture major minor api level said google confirming majorminor release schedule remains seen happen future new manifest attribute allow specify minor api level minimum required sdk release app well initial version support minor api level upcoming q developer preview please try building sdk let u know work q q continue see incremental android release aka qprs provide incremental update help ensure continuous quality new userfacing feature google also continue offer beta system image testing ahead time google hope change enable faster innovation higher level quality polish across release without introducing overhead cost developer google officially confirmed android way promising quickerthanusual release schedule looking forward ai machine learning integration dark mode enhancement people promised x major android update device get fraction google full effort per major release

Is the 20 decillion dollar fine actually real or just some meme? ,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1ggemjp/is_the_20_decillion_dollar_fine_actually_real_or/,17,,"Real. But political. So can probably be ignored. | It is ""real"" in the sense that a Russian court ruled that Google pay a fine of $100K per day that would double every day (or something like that) for taking down over a dozen YouTube channels that Google said violated their terms of service.  The fine was obviously intended to intimidate Google into reinstating the channels - the idea probably being that Google would relent before the amount went into the billions.

Google essentially called their bluff.  They closed the Russian division of YouTube and shut down monetization for users in Russia.  They haven't blocked Russian users from accessing their sites - yet - but in a business sense, they've left.

And there really isn't much that Russia can do about it.  The only leverage Russia had was to prevent Google from operating in Russia, and Google removed that by leaving Russia.

Word is that Russia is attempting to convince a few other countries (Turkey and Serbia for example) to enforce the fine, but odds are pretty good that given the choice between paying or simply leaving, Google would simply leave those countries too.  More likely, those countries aren't going to do anything.

At this point it is just political posturing.  Obviously, Google is never going to pay a 20-decillion dollar fine; they're not even going to pay a billion dollar fine.  It's possible at some point that Google might agree to pay some number just to allow the Russian government to save face - but it will be a fraction of what Google expects to make from resuming operations in Russia. | It's ""real"" but if Russia is ever in a position to enforce the fine, the world is in a bad place.",real political probably ignored real sense russian court ruled google pay fine k per day would double every day something like taking dozen youtube channel google said violated term service fine obviously intended intimidate google reinstating channel idea probably google would relent amount went billion google essentially called bluff closed russian division youtube shut monetization user russia havent blocked russian user accessing site yet business sense theyve left really isnt much russia leverage russia prevent google operating russia google removed leaving russia word russia attempting convince country turkey serbia example enforce fine odds pretty good given choice paying simply leaving google would simply leave country likely country arent going anything point political posturing obviously google never going pay decillion dollar fine theyre even going pay billion dollar fine possible point google might agree pay number allow russian government save face fraction google expects make resuming operation russia real russia ever position enforce fine world bad place
