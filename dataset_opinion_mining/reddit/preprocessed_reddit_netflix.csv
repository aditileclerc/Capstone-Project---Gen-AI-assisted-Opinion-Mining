"I've paid the membership for the wrong country for 6 years! FU Netflix, I'm canceling!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gl1jkf/ive_paid_the_membership_for_the_wrong_country_for/,13,"Here's an interesting story...

I created my Netflix account back in 2018 in Romania, where I've always lived. I received a free month as it was back then without having to submit any payment information. At the end of that first free month, I went on a one-week vacation in Barcelona. During this vacation, I received a notification from Netflix that my complimentary month was ending so I had to add my payment details to continue my membership, which I did. At that time, I the Standard Plan cost the same in Spain as in Romania. I used my PayPal account to pay for the membership, by the way, so I didn't notice anything weird about it.

Fast forward six years, and today I got an email from Netflix telling me that they're increasing the price to 13.99 euros. As I don't usually pay much attention to my automatic subscriptions (I know, my bad!) the price sounded pretty high so I went to the Netflix Romania website where to my surprise, the Standard plan cost only 9.99 euros. So I was like, WTF!? Taking a look at my payment history I see that at least for the last few years, I've been paying 12.99 euros for the Standard Plan. While talking to support, they asked me if I live in Spain because all along I've been paying the cost for the Spanish Standard Plan. I told the support, that I live in Romania and haven't visited Spain since 2018. Of course, they told me there was nothing they couldn't do about it and that I should cancel my current plan and restart it again after it expires to switch to the Romanian price.

Of course, I am partially to blame for this situation, but since Netflix can easily find multiple people abusing a single account, can't they figure out you have lived for the past 6 years in a country and paid the membership for another country? At least a notification or something, FFS.

So yeah, I'm canceling and never getting back! ""Thanks"", Netflix","I think this idea of **Netflix going and mass swapping user accounts from country to country** sounds like it would be a lot more of a problem than the occasional issue you encountered. | The problem with what you're talking about is another issue similar to what I've seen with people starting a streaming service that's only available in one country then blaming that service when they can't cancel unless they do it before leaving the country. It's a 1d10t error, aka user is too lost in their own little world to do what should be a simple effort to check before leaving/joining a service and make sure it's joined/left while in the correct country. Also similar to the ""I'm spending 2/3rds of my time outside my 'home location' for Netflix, and travel to too many countries to have the 'travel' feature apply to all the areas for my usage."" It's not on the streaming service to do what should be easily done by the user, it's not on them to offer anything beyond one country/location as a user's service area, it's not required they offer downloads even if the tier of streaming says that's a feature. If you're too dense to pay attention to what version you're signing up for or checking your bank account every month to see if you're paying for the right version, that's on you.  
  
These are all 'optional' extras offered on what is not legally required to offer anything beyond streaming shows at a single region/country for a single set of users. Hell even the 'streaming shows' isn't a legal requirement as these are private businesses we chose to sign up for and agree to EULA/TOS that is subject to change that we're warned plenty of time ahead. Also seeing a bunch of folks on Netflix and a bunch of other streaming service not understand how a lot of other things work either. 99% of the time any licenses rotate every month, meaning any show or movie, on either platforms that do say or don't say 'this is leaving soon', will lose things. Even programs that were owned by that platform at one time. The licenses required to keep those on the platforms when there's other partial owners mean it's easier to just license it out to someone else who's willing to pay to cover part of those costs. Plus they can be just cheap a-holes who want to save paying the folks who made the programs and will just pull the shows and movies. So you have a limited time to watch every single thing you see on the platform.  
  
Plus there's limitations to every single one of them depending on what version you're using. Ad based netflix doesn't allow casting, depending on where you're located ad based netflix licenses don't allow certain programs to be played with ads, including netflix exclusives because of the other owners. Also things that had features one week might not have them the next, saw someone who was casting European football on Peacock but it stopped working, and they somehow thought it was required it be offered when licenses can restrict that on one particular set of programs as well. Same reason why Peacock had such crap offerings for Olympics and so many other sports, because it was one of the many 'some items that have ads' programs because they paid for part of the licenses, and those licenses only allowed Peacock to hold the replay rights for short periods of time, quite varied depending on the particular event.

Just like any captions/subtitles you're seeing are not required by any laws, yet I've seen users on netflix who want to see both their language and a friend's language as a caption on a program they're watching so both can see stuff that isn't translated on the other caption/sub. In the US any 'caption' requirements for the ADA only apply to things that are or were ever shown on cable/satellite/OTA TV, streaming platforms don't have to do jack squat for captions or subtitles beyond translating the language being spoken, it's another 'bonus' to attract a larger customer base. So they don't have to offer more then a single language to the customer base beyond the original on things that are dubbed, don't have to have any subtitle/caption languages on that audio track beyond the single language being spoken or translated. Some of the other niche streaming platforms aren't allowed to offer anything except a limited number of languages and captions/subtitles even depending on where they're located, so you have to know what you're signing up for to some extent before you sign up. | They, and everyone like them, only “figure out” things that earn them more money.

On the surface, Hugh Grant’s horror debut Heretic is nothing new. Like countless villains before him, the film’s central character, Mr Reed, has an inflated ego, a charismatic disposition and a murderous, misogynistic penchant for luring young women into his house and inflicting psychological and physical harm on them. 

Yet whilst creepy man imprisoning and torturing female captives in his basement is hardly a new trope in the horror canon, I left the cinema feeling oddly refreshed after watching Heretic.

Beneath all the sadism and savagery, the film offered something that I have rarely seen on screen within any genre – least of all horror: a depiction of young, religious women that was, unexpectedly, both invigorating and validating to watch.

The Diplomat Season 2,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1ghrl4f/the_diplomat_season_2/,35,"The diplomat season 1 was one of my favourites netflix shows in a long time. The writing was sharp, nuance and interesting. Kate and Hal have the fish out of the water situation that sometimes is ridiculous, but grounded with discussion about foreign policy and politics.

I was so excited for second season to the point that I rewatched the first season last week. And it still hold up to what I remember. The was a nice blend between homeland and the west wing. Tension and idealism. The writing was so masterfully crafted that I replayed some of the dialogs.

I'm very surprise and somewhat disappointed about season 2. There are still glimpses of the good show from season 1 of course but going through it feel like a slog, compared to season 1 where I felt like I couldn't get enough. 

From storypoint perspective, it moves very slowly and unclear where things are going, except for a few notable scenes such as the church and hosptial discussion scene. Kate and Eidra convo is always a stand out from season 1 but it feels like that overdo it just because it worked well last season. 

Kate as a character feels stuck. At least a few months have passed in the show and she still doesn't remember her staff names and only talkes to a few people again and again. For someone who supposedly a very successful diplomat in a wat zone, she sure has the biggest chip and her shoulder and cant even do well with managing her office and staff. Sure she doesn't like the photoshoot and wearing fancy dresses but grow up. That's the job, she cant just treat her staff badly because of her stress.

To be clear, this is not a criticism on Kerry Russel who have been brilliant and I've admired from The Americans time.

Stuart is just insufferable here. I don't need to explain. He used to be so cool last season.

The Denisson and Kate relationship are just ridiculous now. It was a little bit eye brow raising last season on how much the supposedly party olanning only role for American ambassador has so much push over a British foreign minister. This season is just absurb. He comes to her any time she calls and he just told her the supposed Throwbridge push just as an aside, even though it's huge to tell the US that the UK is going to replace their own PM. 

To be fair I'm only at episode 3 and the only reason I hang on is I know Allison Janney is coming soon. But it's already have the show and we barely have anything happening.

I wonder why the writing took such a nosedive. It's not just about the plot, but the dialogs between characters are so awkward and unnatural. I wonder if it's because of the writers strike that happened and of it affects across the industry. Thinking about House of the Dragon who also had a similar writing nose dive in the second season after an acclaimed first.

Hanging on to this and hope the next few episodes would change my mind. ","It gets worse, much much worse. | I enjoyed it until the ending. I'd be interested to know your reaction when you get there. | I like it but the whole thing is just the plot of House of Cards and UK ambassador fed into an AI prompt.

The new Netflix interface is terrible. Can I revert?,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gh22qg/the_new_netflix_interface_is_terrible_can_i_revert/,17,"Is there any way to opt out of the new Netflix UI rollout? It first appeared for me several months ago and I hated it. It reverted back to the old original for a while thankfully, but is now again using the redesign. 

You see barely a 4th of the information you used to be able to see at once, making going through many titles take longer and become harder to remember as you continue to scroll, as they go out of sight so quickly. Overall the giant tiles are wayyy too big. The tiles are so big that they should be called panels not tiles tbh.

Going through a ton of options took long enough the old way to find something appealing to my tastes, and now takes 4 times as long. You have to scroll through so many more times as only a few giant panels are visible at one time.

Is there anyway to revert or opt out? This is annoying enough for me to avoid Netflix as a go to to find something to watch in favor of other apps/services. ","commenting aswell, new interface is trash, want to revert

Why are so many titles which claim hd capability playing at 960x540p all of the sudden?,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1ggwy8a/why_are_so_many_titles_which_claim_hd_capability/,4,"Just as the title says. They all show ""HD capable"" and, yet, play at 540p resolution. Very few will play at 720p, which is considered ""HD"" (in 2015), and, even more so exceptionally rare, some will actually make it to 1080p (aside from Netflix titles, which all stream 1080p and up).

Has Netflix lost the licensing rights to stream these movies at ""technically"" HD (720p) and actual HD (1080p)? And, if so, why are they still displaying that they are HD capable if their quality is below even the most liberal of standards for ""HD"" (540p)?

This appears to be a recent issue as of the last month. Even movies Im positive I watched 2 months ago at 1920x1080p are streaming at 540p now (Life 2017, Im 100% sure I watched at 1080p).

What we call HD is just the ATSC HD standard, anything over 480 lines is technically HD, but fun fact Windows outright limits what quality you have no matter how good your screen or device is unless you're using a specific browser. The Netflix app isn't a thing anymore on 11, and possibly 10, it's just a fancy Edge window. So that doesn't make much difference. Plus Netflix itself limits it on ALL browsers/desktop devices. Not only that it requires specific things on every single device, cable, and peripheral related to showing video or it won't work.",call hd atsc hd standard anything line technically hd fun fact window outright limit quality matter good screen device unless youre using specific browser netflix app isnt thing anymore possibly fancy edge window doesnt make much difference plus netflix limit browsersdesktop device requires specific thing every single device cable peripheral related showing video wont work
Just finished Alien Abduction in Manhattan. I’m on Carol’s side.,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1ggweji/just_finished_alien_abduction_in_manhattan_im_on/,299,"Carol pissed everyone off because her bullshit meter went a ringing and they couldn’t answer simple questions. I think she exposed them easily and they just couldn’t handle it. 
I think Linda and her son had one genuine experience but then she just made a bunch of shit up to keep Bud interested. Then Bud saw dollar signs and made up the majority of the witnesses. I believe the phenomena in itself is real, but Bud and Linda wanted to make some money. I feel bad for Carol, she just knew bullshit when she saw it.

What are your thoughts ?","I think the whole series showcases societies inability to differentiate compelling circumstantial evidence from verified fact. EVERYTHING deemed as evidence to support Linda's claim was subject to corruption and manipulation. Carol demonstrated that perfectly with the alternative explanation of the x-ray. Which reminds me.....

That little implant supposedly put there by aliens.....where is it? Why not take it out and test it? Why not photograph and test the actual implant. Why not test THE ONLY physical evidence in this case. I'll tell you why.......because that implant is nothing more than a curled up resistor. Almost every electronic device in those days had them. Google it ""Resistor"". There's your alien implant right there. Liars get caught eventually. And when they do, they aren't happy about it. Which makes sense looking back at Linda and Budds reactions to criticism. | Just finished bingeing it. I’m not sure she had *any* experience. Who tells their 6 year old their nightmare was *real* and fucks them up like that? The whole time watching I was expecting to hear that she and Budd were having an affair or something. Nothing real happened from her bullshit story imho. And when challenged by Carol she responds with insults and threats. Paul Heyman should invite her to WWE-perfect synergy when Raw debuts on Netflix, but I digress. Interesting perspectives on opposite ends of the religious spectrum in a way, between her and Carol, who had light years more credibility.
